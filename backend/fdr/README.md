# FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTS

Sourced from https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure. Click on the link to learn more about the files.

Each year, a new zip file will be posted here. Grab the files and save it in this directory. This is how we know what documents to then query.

For now, do this download by hand. Perhaps in the future, we could build an automatic scraper to grab these files.
